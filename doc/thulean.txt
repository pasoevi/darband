Brawl with a pig and you will go away with his stink.
He hath need of his wits who wanders wide.
A man who has his feet hacked off can not scurry far.
There is no such thing as bad weather; only bad clothes.
From harm you grow wise, but not rich.
Blood is thicker than water.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Either conform to the customs or flee the realm.
Fair wind blows even if the sailor can not see it.
He who governs his home, governs his life.
The deepest river is the most silent. 
Don't walk barefooted into a chestnut forest.
Where there is a sea, there are pirates.
Healer, heal yourself!
It is better to be alone than to be in bad company! 
For the best aid seek an old May King and a young May Queen. 
The dead along the dead, and the living along the living. 
A house not seen by the Sun is seen by the healer.
Good health is above wealth.
